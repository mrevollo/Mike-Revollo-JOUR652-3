    <br>

    <p>In 2006, 13-year-old football player Zackery Lystedt was playing a game for his junior high football team in Washington state when he hit his head on the ground after making a tackle on an opposing player. According to his father, Victor, he was on the ground wriggling in pain with both hands holding his head. Zack was not knocked unconcscious, but was clearly in pain. He sat on the sideline to "shake it off" before making his way back into the game, but would eventually collapse on the field and be taken to the hospital for what would prove to be life-saving surgery. Zack, however, was never the same person as he underwent three years of intensive treatment before being able to stand on his two feet with some help. As a result of Zack's serious head injury, concussions in youth sports would be viewed much more seriously not just in football, but in all sports.</p>

      <br>
      <p> Although football is the sport most associated with concussions, soccer has shown it doesn't fall far behind. Based on a sample of high schools around the country, youth football players suffered 201 concussions, according to the Journal of Athletic Training. After football, girls soccer and boys soccer were two of the sports with most concussions suffered at 51 and 33 respectively.</p>

    <br>

    <p>Zack Lystedt's injury, as well as the lasting effects he deals with  from that injury, caught the attention of legislators in Washington state. On May 14, 2009, the Zackery Lystedt Law was passed in Washington, requiring any youth athlete (under the age of 18) that is suspected of suffereing a head injury to not reenter the field of play until they have been evaluated and cleared by a licensed health care provider.</p>

    <p>After the passage of the Lystedt Law, many other states followed suit and passed legislation regarding concussions in youth sports. All 50 states and the District of Columbia would eventually come to have laws concerning concussions in youth sports when Mississippi was the last state to do so, passing legislation on January 30, 2014.</p>

    <br>

    <p>Former Terp and current ESPN soccer analyst Taylor Twellman knows all about suffering concussions and the long-lasting effects they can have if not diagnosed and treated properly. After winning Major League Soccer's MVP and Golden Boot awards in 2005, playing in four MLS Cup finals with the New England Revolution, and make 30 appearances with the U.S. Men's National Team, Twellman was forced to retire from professional soccer on November 3, 2010 at 30 years old due to post-concussion syndrome (PCS). In a segment on ESPN's Outside the Lines, Twellman talked about how his symptoms affected his everyday life after his playing career came to an end.</p>

<br>

<p>To ensure future generations of youth soccer players don't have to endure what he did, Twellman started ThinkTaylor, an organization dedicated to educating parents, coaches, and kids on the dangers of improperly dealing with concussions.</p>

<p>The organization's primary initiative is Concussion Awareness Week in Massachusetts, mainly working with the Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association (MIAA) to encourage those in the youth soccer community to be educated in identifying a concussion and how to properly address it. In 2017, U.S. Soccer teamed up with ThinkTaylor to carry out the initiative on a national scale.</p>

<br>
<br>

<p>Twellman would serve as one of the most prominent voices on concussion education in the United States since his retirement, shaping how the media and all sports teams in the country addressed concussions from the youth through the professional level. His push to seriously address head injuries made its way around the world as well.</p>

<p>At the start of the 2014-2015 season, the Barclays Premier League, one of the most competitive professional soccer leagues in the world, introduced rules on addressing head injuries, which are similar to that of the Lystedt Law in the United States. Furthermore, they require teams to have their players go through neurological testing in preseason to help doctors measure their recovery rate if they do suffer a head injury during the season. England, along with many other countries considered influential members of the international soccer community, have implemented their own concussion protocol, creating an awareness of the dangers of head injuries amongst players and technical staff.</p>

<br>

<p>Over the years, concussions have been on the rise as a result of an increased awareness and ability to identify when a youth athlete has suffered from one. From 2007 to 2014, there has been a 132% increase in diagnosed concussions in the United States, rising from 3,529 reported in 2007 to 8,217 in 2014 according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine. Based on the 43,884 total people who suffered a concussion in the same time period, the age ranges to suffer the most concussions were 15-19 (8,499) and 10-14 (5425). </p>

<br>

<p>As a way to reduce concussions in youth soccer, U.S. Soccer implemented its Concussion Initiative in December 2015. This initaitive included changes in rules such as getting rid of heading the ball for youth players 10 years old and younger, as well as limiting headers to practice sessions for players aged 11 through 13. The safety measure is required to be implemented by US Soccer member clubs, but not required to be enforced by non-member clubs.</p>

<p>According to D.C. United academy coach Gus Teren, he felt this initiative is necessary and beneficial for youth players from a safety and gameplay perspective. It forces everyone involved to be acutely aware of players potentially suffering a concussion, but also encourages players to learn to play with the ball on the ground from a younger age, therefore improving the quality of play. The movement to educate the youth soccer community on concussions came in response to a class-action lawsuit filed by some parents against FIFA (soccer's international governing body), U.S. Soccer, and the American Youth Soccer Organization for being negligent in their management of head injuries.</p>
